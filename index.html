My name is Selihom Teklay. I'm am Eritrean from the Tigray ethnicity. I was born in Asmara, Eritrea. The Tigray are descendants of
a Semitic people who intermixed with the Cushitic inhabitants of the region and founded the Christian kingdom of Aksum, which had
its capital in the historic region of Tigray. The Tigray are a sedentary agricultural people. Religion:  58% Orthodox, 5% Roman
Catholic, less than 1% Protestant, 13% Roman Catholic and others, which includes "Protestants, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's
Witnesses, Buddhist, Hindus, and Baha'is" at less than 5%, are included in the 95% Christianity and  4%  of the population are
Islam in Eritrea.
In Eritrea, in the Tigray religion, bread and injera are one of the main foods. Two of the more common varieties are a thin,
pancake-like bread preferred by most people, and a dense, disk-shaped loaf of baked whole wheat bread. Pancakes are 12 to 18
inches (30 to 45 centimeters) in diameter, and are made from many kinds of cereal grains (wheat, barley, etc.). A variety of
tsebhi (spicy stews ) are eaten with the bread. Eritrean has around eleven holidays and festivals like New Year's Day, Orthodox
Epiphany, Fenkil Day, Birth of the Prophet, Women’s Day, Independence Day, Martyr’s Day, Anniversary of the Start of the Armed
Struggles, Eid al-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha and Christmas Day. Eritreans and Ethiopians are the same in some ways like in foods,hoildays,
festivals and culture.
